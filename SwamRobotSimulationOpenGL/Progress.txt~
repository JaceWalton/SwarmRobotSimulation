neurons drawing and moving working on aiming them to the average of all of there angles.
for some reason this value is amost always between 90 and 180, the lower left quatdrant of the screen.
another issue is that thrut does not change my directon vector in relation to my currnet angle... need to work on that...

Goal: movement without thrust and findout why angle is betwixt 90 mand 180
Start 12:00
move without thrust works 
not sure why angles converge to lower left quadrent... ????
gave add functions to velocity and neuron 
started pseudo code for finding closest neighbor and 6 ways to change angle of neurons
confermed finding closest neighbor works!!!!
   I did this by breaking the look during the first iteration then drawing circles on the 0 neruon and jClosest neighbor

Tasks to solve
with average angles they converge to betwixt 90 and 180 deg +/_ some
whitch motion is best for swarm motion?
      // 1 set angle i to angle i
      // 2 converge i's angle to j's angle
      // 3 point i to j
      // 4 convetge i's angle to point to j
      // 5 point i to avg of two
      // 6 converge i to avg of two
