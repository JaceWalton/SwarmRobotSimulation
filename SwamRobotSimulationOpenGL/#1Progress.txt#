neurons drawing and moving working on aiming them to the average of all of there angles.
for some reason this value is amost always between 90 and 180, the lower left quatdrant of the screen.
another issue is that thrut does not change my directon vector in relation to my currnet angle... need to work on that...

May/9/2015
Goal: movement without thrust and findout why angle is betwixt 90 mand 180
start 12:00
end   3:15
time  3.25 hours
move without thrust works 
not sure why angles converge to lower left quadrent... ????
gave add functions to velocity and neuron 
started pseudo code for finding closest neighbor and 6 ways to change angle of neurons
confermed finding closest neighbor works!!!!
   I did this by breaking the look during the first iteration then drawing circles on the 0 neruon and jClosest neighbor

Goal: redraw, bots drawNumber Index, line from one bot not neighbor.

I was tackling the issue wonge. I was trying to change only the angle.
In thinking about the way to converge distance I realized that I would need to change the angle to chage distance betwixt. 
for example...
if far aim toards neighbor 
if close   converge    to avg?, to neightor, to goal, to waypoint?
Waypoint path to goal around object place waypoints 
min dist did not work, several errors. I was comparing dist to distPrevious
this would not find the minimum then I compared dist to a min var whitch I initialized as a vlaue higher that any value could be i looked up some alogorythms on line and then did a desktest on paper and realized i need to reinitialize min for each loop I finished it about 15 min befor the lab closed
Such a great day!

convItowardJ not working yet....
I think that I am going about the process wrong I am focusing on angle and changing angle by angle parameters I should change angle by distance parameters. other two functions planed work they look great!
tried to make angle horizontal rather than vertical. Not sure how

Goal: get point-to-taget to work. it works fine for drone in superman but it has issues in my code. have a arrow pointer drawn to point to neighbor If there is time get angle to be unit circle compliant
start 1:45
end 5:15
time 3 hrs
point-to-target only needed to have -90 inscerted into set angle changing parameters
in convItowardJbots increase angle or decrease angle to meet point to neighbor a bot will sometimes move 3/4 of a turn to point at its neighbor. how to fix?
I made a new funciton to calcAngleToTarget to modualarize it. 
Also a function to lineBetwixtAll that are 200 pixles apart. This is to modle the spring metod of grouping as stated below. 
Considering Omnidirectional bot.
still using angle to change angle rather that dist to change dist.

Goal: Start orginizing behavior classes 
start 12:15
end 3:15
time 3 hrs
This is going to be tough.... I am have the code organized to be controled by the Ganglion class. I have an array of Neurons in Ganglion and now have to acess the neurons inside of behavior which is inside of neuron. kindof a deadlock problem. 
I could just have Ganlion be the behavior class and have an int in neuron that indicates the current behavior.
after 1.5 hrs i returned to original code.... what to do?
started working on distance parameter rather than angle

May/19/2015
Goal: negitive angels 
start 6:15
end 8:15
time 2 hrs
I fixed neg angles by ensuring that they are positive whenever angle is changed
I tinkered with the convRadiusAll and linebetwixtClosest... I feel that I havent made much progress for a few days.... I need to figure out how to have behaviors for each bot rather than they being mindless drones...

That was easy i just dynamicaly alocated a number of wayPoints and set a wayPoint to the current point of each bot. The tail is as many frames as I have wayPoints. for what I did dynamic alocation was not nessiarary howver when I get to chage the trail length and such I will need to re-allocate a new number a way points. that is less stuff to change later.

Feeling board... wiched to converg dist now I am goig for PID error control
emplimenting some PID it lis looking sort of good, Some bots jsut won't listen and some seem to get it.... they are all being controled by the same algorythm... why do only some work...

Goal: PID and Rondezvouse
start 3:00
end 6:15
time 3.25 hr
"worked" on PID for a bit.... then I got board and decided to do figure out rondezvouse it was kind of easy. I though I wanted to overload the + operator. Turns out no I don't.... I then tried to do an addPt function and that would have the Y (and I think the X) axis off abit on the "center off mass" of the swarm. I then descretly summed the x and y of each bot, it finaly worked! it looks great soon I am going to start working on some more complex behaviors, after I figure smooth out some of the current functions. 
next time I am going to smooth out the other function I have been spending to much time worriying about how to make each bot independant, during the scope of THIS project there will be a global behavior control class.

June/2/2015
Goal: clean up ganglion.cpp make the functions look nice and work nice (IE do what they are named for). some funcitons may take parameters (such as rondezvouse) and point bots to the paramter point , center | origin | goal ect.

end 6:45 
time 1.25 hr
I broke up rondezvous and convClosest (was lineBetwixtClosest). I am considering getting rid of lineBetwixtAll and convAvgRadius what do they even do? they just look cool.... sort of...
so now rondezvous is a high level behavior make up of low level sub-behaviors. Same for convClosest I have made some more things more modular, not sure what to do with keep dist and I want to be able to move an object.

added buttons to uiInteract a,s,d,f,b and 0-9. unfortunatly there are two types of buttons one is a bool and is more of and even like the space bar. the arrow keys deal with how long the key has been pressed. I am not sure if I can do the other key presses I need to find out how to get other keys pressed. Also I may put mouse features into the simulation. Thus the mouse pointer can be either a goal, obstical or preditor.  
Got some videos for prenting tomorrow. I am not sure why I was not prenting so far. I hope that I will not be docked for this.

I did it! finaly! I found out that I was tuning the PID correctly before but all of my angles were ints', so I went through all files and changes angles to floats. I learned about type deff form Brady, it is like #define or enum but you can define your type and change it as you need over the entire program! I will have to empliment this. I then tried to put the PID into its own function It returns float and take float parameters and I pass in floats but it has wierd errors (undefined reference to `Ganglion::PID(float, float, float, float) ) that  will be my next fix

undefined ref was becuse I did not have PID as Ganglion:: ... noob...
Got rid of ConvAvgRadius (put it in ganglionBehaviors/ganglion.cpp) and made lineBetwixtAll to do only what it says also put PID into conv to Goal and therefore rondezvous.
made lineBetwixtClosest only draw line betwixt closest PID needs error boud cheacking.

Tasks to solve
with average angles they converge to betwixt 90 and 180 deg +/_ some
think that it 

whitch angle control is best for the swarm motion I am wanting?


4 converge to Goal/waypoint  done calcAngleToTarget()

other ideas to implement....
model of a spring connecting bot to neighbors (closest or withing radius or feild of view?) to maintain distance 
speed starts random and converges to meet at moderate speed.

*********idea of converging angle speed and distance !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
how to give each bot its own mind rather than havnig an omnicent queen bot. 
each bot moves by following its own set of rules 

differnt colors 
bots realtion lines change with wrap??????
how to create path? with waypoints?
PID
mouse and non-event buttons see brother Helfich
